                I'm thrilled to share that our team, Tech Titans, <br> recently participated in DD Robocon 2024, held at Thyagaraj Stadium, New Delhi <br> <br>

                Throughout the journey of DD Robocon 2024, I learned a tremendous amount about robotics, <br> both from a technical and non-technical perspective. <br> Starting from the basics, my knowledge and skills in robotics have grown exponentially thanks to the support and collaboration within Team Tech Titans<br><br>
                We gave our best effort in the competition, and while some things were beyond our control, the experience was invaluable. We encountered various cutting-edge technologies and faced numerous challenges, all of which have made us stronger and more determined.
